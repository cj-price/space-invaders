* Getting Started with Development
** Installation
To start working on this project, some libraries must be downloaded:
1) clojure
2) node and npm (preferably using nvm)
3) [[https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs][shadow-cljs]]
4) [[https://babashka.org/][babashka]]

** Development
Next, we need to setup a dev http server to see the changes that we made. Simply run ~bb watch~ at the project root. After the build is completed, the application should be on port ~3449~. Navigating to ~http://localhost:3449~ should result in an alien invasion.
